PCAP (Packet capture), is rich in information. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost in the amount of information and start on wrong tracks. Throughout this MOOC, I will introduce you the methodology to be adopted to deal with this type of situation. Firstly, I will try to describe the PCAP content, list some tools and finally practical exercises resulting from CTF tests or malicious traffic.</description></item><item><title>Doing CTF without paying VPS</title><link>maki.bzh/shorts/dontpayvps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 21:57:40 +0800</pubDate><author>Maki</author><guid>maki.bzh/shorts/dontpayvps/</guid><description><![CDATA[The goal I think many of us do CTFs, but also many of us don&rsquo;t have any money, because we&rsquo;re student or addict to drugs. So when you don&rsquo;t have any money, you get creative.
For webguys who are looking for a reverse shell or who want admin cookies on a remote host (hello root-me), but don&rsquo;t want to pay for a VPS, there is a free solution. Ngrok.
How it works?]]></description></item><item><title>Custom firmware for Rapsberry Pi 3 using buildroot</title><link>maki.bzh/shorts/customfirmwarerpi3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 21:57:40 +0800</pubDate><author>Maki</author><guid>maki.bzh/shorts/customfirmwarerpi3/</guid><description>I. Step 1 In this first part, we had to set up the buildroot system basis.
Goals of this part are:
Minimal buildroot configuration Copy the new firmware on RPi SD card I.1. Base system specification After downloaded the last release of buildroot, I prepared the build for Raspberry Pi 3 architecture.
1 make raspberrypi3_defconfig In this interface “menuconfig”, I have to initiate the RAM filesystem:
1 Filesystem images → initial RAM filesystem linked into linux kernel Furthermore, as we can see in the picture above, I disabled the ext3/4 filesystem, it’s not necessary here.</description></item><item><title>Python3 Requests for fun and...

It&rsquo;s very helpful in daily life or in CTF&hellip;
And actually, there is EuropeanCyberWeek CTF, so let&rsquo;s try to do something useful: Auto flag submitter
State of the art First of all, I need the requests structure, to get this information, just open BurpSuite (if you&rsquo;re a bit stupid like me), or you&rsquo;re Firefox web console and request the chosen challenge (Drone Wars 3 for example).]]></description></item></channel></rss>
