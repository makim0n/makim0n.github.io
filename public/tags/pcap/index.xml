Etat des lieux A l&rsquo;ouverture du PCAP, on peut voir énormément de paquets entre l&rsquo;ip 172.17.0.5 et 172.17.0.1.

For this flag I don&amp;rsquo;t have any real analysis, I just opened the PCAP file and looked at the different TCP conversations.</description></item><item><title>[TamuCTF 2019] - Reading rainbow</title><link>maki.bzh/writeups/tamu2019readingrainbow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:57:40 +0800</pubDate><author>Maki</author><guid>maki.bzh/writeups/tamu2019readingrainbow/</guid><description>Recently, the office put up a private webserver to store important information about the newest research project for the company. This information was to be kept confidential, as it&amp;rsquo;s release could mean a large loss for everyone in the office. Just as the research was about to be published, a competing firm published information eerily similar.

PCAP (Packet capture), is rich in information. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost in the amount of information and start on wrong tracks. Throughout this MOOC, I will introduce you the methodology to be adopted to deal with this type of situation. Firstly, I will try to describe the PCAP content, list some tools and finally practical exercises resulting from CTF tests or malicious traffic.</description></item><item><title>[OtterCTF] - Network</title><link>maki.bzh/writeups/otterctf2018network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 21:57:40 +0800</pubDate><author>Maki</author><guid>maki.bzh/writeups/otterctf2018network/</guid><description>Network There are 4 network challenges during this CTF, I only solved 3 of them, here is how.
Birdman&amp;rsquo;s Data State of the art The PCAP file is not really big, I decided to open it using Wireshark. There are few things to notice:
Data in UDP protocol HTTP packets to txtwizard.net There nothing interesting in UDP traffic, data does not represent much.
On the other hand, HTTP traffic is very interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
